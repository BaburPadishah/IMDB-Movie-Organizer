# IMDB-Movie-Organizer
This program prompts the user for a movie title (required) and a year (optional) and searches IMDB with those parameters. 
It then displays information about the results, including title, director, year, and runtime.
The user is then given the option to add information on what format they own the title in and what release studio its from, and export the results to a text file.

TODO:
* Speed up the search (current search time = 45 seconds)
  * reducing list sizes
  * implementing binary search 
  * using a while not found loop instead of a for loop
* Create Search tab widgets
* addToList Button
* Progress bar?
